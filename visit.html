	    	<h2>Hours of Operation</h2>
		    	<p>The Eiffel Tower is open every day of the year. With the exception of certain holidays that either extend or reduce admission times, regular hours of operation from mid-June through early September are 9:00 a.m. to 12:45 a.m., though the last elevator ride to the top departs at 11:00 p.m.
                   For the remainder of the year, the tower is open from 9:30 a.m. until 11:45 p.m., with the last elevator ascending at 10:30 p.m. Times for stair access are similar to those for the elevators during peak season (mid-June through early September) and drastically cut back to 9:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. the rest of the year.</p>
		
	    	<h2>Admission Costs</h2>
			    <p>Eiffel Tower ticket costs vary wildly. Adults over the age of 25 willing to take the 704 stairs to the second floor pay 7 euros, those aged 12 to 24 years pay 5 euros, and children 4 to 11 pay 3 euros. Admission tickets with elevator access to the second floor cost 11 euros, 8.50 euros, and 4 euros, respectively.
	               Third-floor admission tickets via the elevators cost 17 euros for adults over 25, 14.50 euros for those 12 through 24 years old, and 8 euros for kids ages 4 through 11. Children aged 3 and under enter for free with a paid accompanying adult.
                   Discounted rates are available for disabled persons and their companions, groups of 20 or more, and French job seekers. Stair-access tickets are not sold online.</p>
		
            <h2>Visit Off-Peak to Avoid Long Ticket Lines</h2>
				<p>Expect wait times greater than two hours from mid-July through late August; and less than 30 minutes during weekdays in January, February, the early part of March, and again November through mid-December.
				When planning a visit, check out the Eiffel Tower’s calendar for peak and off-peak visit periods.</p>
				
	    	<h2>General Admission Doesn’t Include the Summit</h2>
				<p>General-admission tickets, which sell for 11 euros, do not include summit access. Top-floor-inclusive tickets cost 17 euros. Summit-access tickets occasionally sell out in advance, which is when going with a tour operator may be your last ditch effort to secure summit tickets.
                   Aside from amazing panoramic 360-degree views of Paris, the third floor features a restroom, Gustave Eiffell’s office, and the Champagne bar.</p>
